Scholarify
=================

Scholarify tackles the credentialing issue in online education by offering self-directed learners first the ability to find their profession of choice, then discover learning material relevant to that profession, and finally prove that they possess the skills required to pursue it.

Playing around with highly targeted Facebook ads (e.g. software engineers that like Salman Khan, Udacity or Coursera), Scholarify attracted a community of >10,000 individuals.

UPDATE: 

The idea of Scholarify has evolved into what is now Makerscore (http://www.makerscore.com).

As I'm not working on Scholarify anymore, I decided to open-source the code to (a) unveil how - let's call it "minimal" - Scholarify's codebase looked like in its early days, (b) to give some ideas of how a production app might be structured in Meteor (even though this cannot even closely be called "best practice" nor even "good practice"), and (c) to allow anyone still interested in advancing the original vision to take over the project.
